# Nematostella Mesocosm Virome/Transcriptome Study - Overview
This repository contains the virome and transcriptome work for our 2022 Mesoccosm study looking at how Nematostella from different locations interact with microbes and viruses from a foreign environment. 

Study Info and Sample Structure: 
We have sequencing data from animals from 7 locations: Field (NH)	; 	NS	;	ME	;	NH	;	MA 	; SC ;	FL for two time points: T0 and T14 with 3 replicates for each sample. 

Where NS	;	ME	;	NH	;	MA 	; SC ;	FL animals were sampled at our intial time point (T0) before going into the mesocosom which was conducted in NH at the Jackson Estuarine Laboratory. The mesocosoms were bins filled with water from the estuary that was bag filtered to remove larger debris. Water changes occured every other day, and each mesocosm bin had a pump to produce water flow for the animals. Animals were exposed to the NH estuarine water for 14 days when we collected our last time pint (T14). In addition to the Mesocosom sampling, we also collected animals from the natural populations in NH (Field animals) to use as a control. 

Our Main study question is: Does the origin of location impact the type and diversity of viruses and bacteria that assoiciate with Nematostella?
